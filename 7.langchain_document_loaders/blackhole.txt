**Whispers of the Black Hole**

In silent skies so dark and deep,
A black hole stirs where stars once sleep.
It bends the light, it swallows sound,
Where time and space are tightly wound.

A cosmic gate, both fierce and sly,
It drinks the dreams of passersby.
Yet in its pull, a beauty lies—
The universe in shadowed guise.

No cries escape, no echoes flee,
Just silence in eternity.
It holds the past in folded skin,
A maze where none return again.

It spins with grace, devours with art,
A void with gravity’s black heart.
Yet from its edge, strange light is thrown—
As if the dark must still be known.

So let it swirl in velvet night,
A phantom dance beyond our sight.
Not death, perhaps—but something whole,
The sacred hush of a black hole.
